Modified Bayesian gravity adjustment.
We proposes a modified Bayesian network adjustment (MBGA) method, which is an improved version of the Bayesian network adjustment (BGA) method in Chen et al. (2019, J. of Geodesy), to estimate the scale factor in a hybrid gravity network that generally includes several absolute gravity datum stations.
This package is the revised version of gravity module in Geoist package (https://github.com/igp-gravity/geoist.git). In order to facilitate users to use and test, we build the modified gravity module into MBGA.
