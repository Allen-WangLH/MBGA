Modified Bayesian gravity adjustment
We proposes a modified Bayesian network adjustment (MBGA) method, which is an improved version of the Bayesian network adjustment (BGA) method in Chen et al. (2019, J. of Geodesy), to estimate the scale factor in a hybrid gravity network that generally includes several absolute gravity datum stations.
